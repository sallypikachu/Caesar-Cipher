# Simple Caesar Cipher

Caesar Cipher was one of the simplest and widely used encryption system. It was named after Julius Caesar, who used it to correspond with his army and personals.
Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where a letter is substituted by another letter determined by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet or a shift.

Here I created a simple Caesar Cipher and an another cipher using ASCII decimal to glyph code. Using the ruby method `tr`, I can easily substitute the characters of my message by supplying the plaintext and the ciphertext.
